Easily send email from your WordPress site through Mailgun using the HTTP API or SMTP.


== Description ==

[Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) is the email automation engine trusted by over 10,000 website and application developers for sending, receiving and tracking emails. By taking advantage of Mailgun's powerful email APIs, developers can spend more time building awesome websites and less time fighting with email servers. Mailgun supports all of the most popular languages including PHP, Ruby, Python, C# and Java.

One particularly useful feature of this plugin is that it provides you with a way to send email when the server you are on does not support SMTP or where outbound SMTP is restricted since the plug-in uses the Mailgun HTTP API for sending email by default. All you need to use the plugin is a [Mailgun account](http://www.mailgun.com/). Mailgun has a free account that lets you send up to 200 emails per day, which is great for testing. Paid subscriptions are available for increased limits.

The latest version of this plugin now supports regions. Select either U.S./North America or Europe to choose the API endpoint from which you will send email.

The current version of this plugin only handles sending emails, tracking and tagging and list subscription. 


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mailgun` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install directly through the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or by using the link provided by the plugin installer
3. Visit the settings page in the Admin at `Settings -> Mailgun` and configure the plugin with your account details
4. Click the Test Configuration button to verify that your settings are correct.
5. Click View Available Lists to review shortcode settings for lists in your Mailgun account that you may wish to help users subscribe to


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

- Testing the configuration fails when using the HTTP API

Your web server may not allow outbound HTTP connections. Set `Use HTTP API` to "No", and fill out the configuration options to SMTP and test again.

- Testing the configuration fails when using SMTP

Your web server may not allow outbound SMTP connections on port 465 for secure connections or 587 for unsecured connections. Try changing `Use Secure SMTP` to "No" or "Yes" depending on your current configuration and testing again. If both fail, try setting `Use HTTP API` to "Yes" and testing again.

If you *have* to use SMTP and something is still going horribly wrong, enable debug mode in WordPress and also add the `MG_DEBUG_SMTP` constant to your `wp-config.php`, like so:

`
define( 'MG_DEBUG_SMTP', true );
`

- Can this be configured globally for WordPress Multisite?

Yes, using the following constants that can be placed in wp-config.php:

`
MAILGUN_REGION       Type: string   Choices: 'us' or 'eu'
     ex. define('MAILGUN_REGION', 'us');
MAILGUN_USEAPI       Type: boolean  Choices: '0' or '1' (0 = false/no)
MAILGUN_APIKEY       Type: string
MAILGUN_DOMAIN       Type: string
MAILGUN_USERNAME     Type: string
MAILGUN_PASSWORD     Type: string
MAILGUN_SECURE       Type: boolean  Choices: '0' or '1' (0 = false/no)
MAILGUN_SECTYPE      Type: string   Choices: 'ssl' or 'tls'
MAILGUN_FROM_NAME    Type: string
MAILGUN_FROM_ADDRESS Type: string
`
